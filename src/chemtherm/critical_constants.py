        Notes
        -----
        The critical constants are taken from Table 2-141 of Perry's Chemical
        Engineering Handbook, 8th Edition. At the same time, values in that
        table were taken from the Design Institute for Physical Properties
        (DIPPR) of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE),
        copyright 2007 AIChE and reproduced with permission of AICHE and of
        the DIPPR Evaluated Process Design Data Project Steering Committee.

        The number of digits provided for the acentric factor was chosen for
        uniformity of appearence and formatting; these do not represent the
        uncertainties of the physical quantities, but are the result of
        calculations from the standard thermophysical property formulation
        within a fixed format.
