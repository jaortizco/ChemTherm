        Notes
        -----
        - The formation properties are taken from Table 2-179 of Perry's
        Chemical Engineering Handbook, 8th Edition. At the same time,
        values in that table were taken from the Design Institute for Physical
        Properties (DIPPR) of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers
        (AIChE), copyright 2007 AIChE and reproduced with permission of AICHE
        and of the DIPPR Evaluated Process Design Data Project Steering
        Committee. Their source should be cited as R. L. Rowley,

        - For CH2ClF2, the formation properties are taken from the "Standard
        Thermodynamic Properties of Chemical Substances" table in
        Section 5, 5-4 of the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics
        (84th edition). Lide, D. R. (2003)
